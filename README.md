# express_rs

> A minimal and blazing-fast web framework for Rust, inspired by [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

## üöÄ Overview

**express_rs** aims to provide a clean, expressive, and flexible web framework modeled after the ergonomics of Express.js, but with the performance and safety guarantees of Rust.

The goal is to keep things simple, fast, and ergonomic ‚Äî no macros, no ceremony ‚Äî just modular, async-first routing, middlewares, and handler composition.

## ‚úÖ Features (Implemented)

- [x] Express-style routing with `.get()`, `.post()`, etc.
- [x] Middleware system (`app.use(...)`) with layered composition
- [x] Minimal `App` type (no macro or derive required)
- [x] Request + Response types with mutable APIs
- [x] Route parameter extraction (`/user/:id`)
- [x] Route handler abstraction (`Handler`) with `Next`
- [x] Logging with method, path and elapsed time
- [x] Built-in response helpers (e.g., `.send()`, `.json()`, `.status()`)
- [x] File serving with streaming optimization + LRU cache
- [x] MIME type detection (via [`mime_guess`] and [`infer`])
- [x] Route matching via fast radix tree (`matchthem`)
- [x] Global string interner for path and param deduplication
- [x] Type-safe per-request parameter access via extension API
- [x] MethodKind enum + method bitflag support

## üõ†Ô∏è Goals & Roadmap

### Core Architecture

- [x] Internal `App` struct with lazy router initialization
- [x] `Router` type with per-method route trees
- [x] Middleware pipeline with early return support
- [x] Symbol-based interned parameters

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Static type-safe API for request extensions (`.locals`, etc.)
- [ ] Global `AppState<T>` support like Actix
- [ ] Built-in logging/tracing macros with levels
- [ ] Built-in `.env` support for config (optional)
- [ ] Pluggable middleware (logger, body-parser, etc.)

### Advanced Routing

- [ ] Path prefix mounting (`app.use('/api', apiApp)`)
- [ ] Route grouping (`router.route('/users').get(...).post(...)`)
- [ ] Optional trailing slash handling
- [ ] Regex or wildcard segments (`*` / `.*`)

### Performance

- [ ] Benchmarks against Axum/Actix/Warp
- [ ] Zero-copy response body writing
- [ ] Avoid all heap allocations in hot path
- [x] Smallvec for handler/index lists

## üß™ Example

```rust
use express_rs::App;

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::default();

    app.get("/", |req, res, _| {
        res.send("Hello from Rust!");
    });

    app.listen(3000, || {
        println!("üöÄ Listening on http://localhost:3000");
    });
}
```
